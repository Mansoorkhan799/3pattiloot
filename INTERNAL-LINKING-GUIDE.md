# Internal Linking Strategy - SEO Boost 🔗

## ✅ What I Just Implemented:

### 1. **Homepage → Blog Posts** (Contextual Links)

Added relevant internal links from homepage sections to related blog posts:

```
"📖 Need help? Read our complete signup and login guide"
```
Links to: `/blog/signup-login`

#### Tips Section → Tips & Tricks Guide  
```
"🎯 Want expert strategies? Read our advanced tips and tricks guide"
```
Links to: `/blog/tips-tricks`

#### Existing Blog CTA
```
"Read Our Blog & Guides →"
```
Links to: `/blog`

### 2. **Blog Posts → Homepage**

Each blog post now has a "Related Guides" section at the bottom with:
- 🏠 **Back to Home** - Links to homepage
- Links to other related blog posts
- Cross-linking between all blog content

### 3. **Blog Posts → Other Blog Posts**

Each blog post links to 3 other relevant posts:
- Signup Guide → Deposit Guide, Tips, Best Games
- Deposit Guide → Signup, Tips, Best Games
