## ❓ Why Blogs Might Not Be Indexed Yet:

1. **New Site** - If your site is new (< 1 month), Google takes time
2. **Not Submitted** - Sitemap not submitted to Search Console
3. **Low Authority** - New domains need to build trust
4. **Not Crawled Yet** - Google hasn't visited the pages yet

- [ ] Request indexing for all 4 blog posts individually
- [ ] Share blog posts on social media (Facebook, Twitter)
- [ ] Add internal links between blog posts
- [ ] Wait 7-14 days and check `site:3pattilootapk.com.pk/blog`
